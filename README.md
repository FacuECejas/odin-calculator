# Project: Calculator

This is a project for The Odin Project's 'JavaScript Basics' Course, and it's the final project of the 'Foundations' section.

The project consists of a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations.
In the implementation of this project, I included the following features:
- The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The calculator can handle multiple operations in a row.
- The calculator can handle decimal numbers.
- The calculator can change the sign of a number.
- The calculator has a backspace key.
- The calculator has a 'clear' key.
- The calculator has Error and Boundary checks.
- The calculator has keyboard support (but just for some keys).


This projects covers the following topics:
- Mainly DOM manipulation and Event handling.
- Basics of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

I tried to follow the problem-solving approach of breaking down the problem into smaller parts and solving them one by one.

In this project I had to debbug multiple times, go to the documentation and search for solutions.

I covered all the requirements with good practices in mind, making the code clean and readable as well as the commit messages.
